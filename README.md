# Gareth and Meraz's Final Project  

### Idea

Our goal is to make a rock-paper-scissors game, using Flask to make it playable in-browser. The program will use a weighted average method in order to better guess what an opponent might throw, as well as provide different weighting options, and will also keep track of wins and losses. Choices will be made through button input.
