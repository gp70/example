# Gareth and Meraz's Final Project  

### Idea

Our goal is to make a rock-paper-scissors game, using Flask to make it playable in-browser. The program will use a weighted average method in order to decide what to throw, as well as provide different weighting options, and will also keep track of wins and losses. Choices will be made through form input.

### Usage

Run 'app.py,' then put "localhost:5000" into the address bar of a browser
